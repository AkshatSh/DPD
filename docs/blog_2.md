## Second Blog Post

### Pros and Cons of each Idea

From the previous blog post, we identified 3 directions to go down for generating labeling functions


#### Embedding space

**Pros**

- Item 1

**Cons**

- Item 1


#### Structural information

**Pros**

- Item 1

**Cons**

- Item 1


#### Regex/Pattern Matching

**Pros**

- Item 1

**Cons**

- Item 1

### Final Plan


### Codebases

We will build our models in PyTorch [1] and potentially using AllenNLP [6]. We will build our system ontop of Snorkel [2]. We will compare our implementation against Snuba/Reef [3] and AutoNER [5], and use Snorkel MeTal (a implementation of Snorkel for GLUE) [4] to help with writing models for sequence classification.


### Lecture

A lecture on important linguistic features for different NLP tasks would be useful.
